# Integers Conversion Encoding Site Meeting Notes: 01/04/23


## Agenda

   1. 32-Bit Encodings
      - "Invalid Input" when input goes above 32 bits (Vaish or Vica)
      - More things to fix, must meet with Prof. Fitzgerald

   1. Decimal to Binary Conversion (Luis)
      - align = 
      - takes up a lot of space unnecessarily
         * split in half; make right side whole number conversion, right side mantissa conversion 
            - Mantissa conversion
               * "top to bottom" and "bottom to top" labels
            - Final Answer
               * live appearance (as each step occurs, answer grows from decimal)

   1. Binary to Decimal Conversion (Vaish + Vica)
      - get started on it

   1. Page with links to tables (Henry)
      - learning Bootstrap

   1. Mobile Functionality (Luis)
      - media query
      - looks good so far, waiting on notes from Prof. Fitzgerald

   1. Eventually add floating point encoding section...


## Notes

   1. How to work + push: Work on a seperate branch, merge branches, push.
      - Vaish will send us the commands necessary to do so.

   1. Vica: Let Prof. Fitzgerald know that we've resumed working on the site.

   1. General Deadline for the above mentioned Agenda: 1 week (Due: 01/11/23)


## Questions for Prof. Fitzgerald

      - how to format on mobile

   1. 32-Bit Encodings issues
      - May we have some testcases?
